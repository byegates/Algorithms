# Largest BST Subtree
[LaiCode: 467](https://app.laicode.io/app/problem/467)

[LeetCode: 333](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-bst-subtree/)
## Description
Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.

Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.
Here's an example:

<pre>
   10
   / \
  5  15
 / \   \
1   8   7
</pre>

The Largest BST Subtree in this case is
<pre>
  5
 / \
1   8
</pre>
The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.

Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?

## Analysis
This is similar to the problem where we check whether a binary tree is balanced in O(n) time.
In that problem we calculate tree height and determine whether tree is balanced or not at the same, and we only need to traverse the tree once.

We could do similar thing here, but there's more work required,
we need to know the **min and max value of both left and right subtree** at all time,
to determine whether it's a BST or not;
we also need to know **the size of each subtree**. (could use -1 to say the tree is not BST, as we don't care about the size in this case)

### Base/Corner Case
If given Binary Tree is null, we return 0 immediately, do not let null node gets into Recursion.

### What do we want from subtrees (What do we return to parent nodes)
Whether Each Subtree is BST

If BST, the size, min value, max value of the whole subtree

As size can be only positive numbers, we use size = -1 to indicate a subtree is not BST

### What do we do at current level
Because null node can't get into Recursion (will use our recursion logic to ensure this too),
so once we are in recursion logic, we have at least one node, so we start with size 1,
and the max and min value range will both default to root value itself (if it's a leaf node, i.e. only node in this subtree).

If left node is not null, we traverse to left node, get the size and left subtree value range.
When left subtree is BST(i.e. size != -1) and root.key > left.Max,
That means left subtree is good for root to use,
so we add left size to current tree size (starting with 1)
and update cur.Min to left.Min ('cause for BST, whole subtree min value would come from left subtree).

Then we do the same logic to right subtree.

Last step we update global max with size and then return the whole cur subtree result to parent level.

either left or right subtree could update cur tree size to -1, in which case, -1 will be returned, and it won't update global max as global max starts with 0.

### NOTE
If left subtree return size as -1 (meaning it's not BST),
we still need to run recursion to the right side,
although this subtree and it's parents can never be a BST,
but subtrees of right subtree could still update global max;

## Time Complexity
O(n)

n be all nodes in tree, we traversal all nodes in the whole once, and only once

## Space Complexity
O(height) (log(n) ~ n)

Recursion tree height.

## Code

### Easier to understand?
```java
class Solution {
    static class Result {
        int size, min, max;

        Result(int size, int min, int max) {
            this.size = size;
            this.min = min;
            this.max = max;
        }
    }

    public int largestBSTSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int[] res = new int[1];
        dfs(root, res);
        return res[0];
    }

    private Result dfs(TreeNode root, int[] res) {
        // root will not be null, so the size is at least 1
        Result cur = new Result(1, root.key, root.key);
        
        if (root.left != null) {
            Result left = dfs(root.left, res);
            if (left.size != -1 && root.key > left.max) {
                cur.min = left.min;
                cur.size += left.size;
            } else cur.size = -1;
        }

        if (root.right != null) {
            Result right = dfs(root.right, res);
            if (cur.size != -1 && right.size != -1 && root.key < right.min) {
                cur.max = right.max;
                cur.size += right.size;
            } else cur.size = -1;
        }

        if (cur.size > res[0]) res[0] = cur.size;

        return cur;
    }
}
```
### A shorter(not necessarily better) version
```java
import util.TreeNode;

class Solution {
    static class Result {
        int size, min, max;

        Result(int size, int min, int max) {
            this.size = size;
            this.min = min;
            this.max = max;
        }
    }

    public int largestBSTSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int[] res = new int[1];
        dfs(root, res);
        return res[0];
    }

    private Result dfs(TreeNode root, int[] res) {
        if (root == null) return new Result(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);

        Result left = dfs(root.left, res);
        Result right = dfs(root.right, res);

        if (left.size == -1 || root.key <= left.max || right.size == -1 || root.key >= right.min)
            return new Result(-1, 0, 0);

        Result cur = new Result(left.size + right.size + 1, Math.min(left.min, root.key), Math.max(right.max, root.key));

        if (cur.size > res[0]) res[0] = cur.size;

        return cur;
    }
}
